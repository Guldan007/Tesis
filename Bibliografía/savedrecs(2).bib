Abstract = {The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1, SLC22A1) transports a large
   number of structurally diverse endogenous and exogenous substrates.
   There are numerous known competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of
   OCT1, but there are no studies systematically analyzing the relationship
   between transport, stimulation, and inhibition. Here, we tested in vitro
   OCT1 inhibition by OCT1 substrates and transport of OCT1 inhibitors
   under uniform analytical conditions. Beyond inhibition testing with two
   model substrates, we tested nine additional OCT1 substrates for their
   mutual inhibition. Inhibition of ASP(+) uptake by most OCT1 substrates
   was weak. The model substrate sumatriptan, with its moderately stronger
   inhibitability, was used to confirm this. Interestingly, OCT1 substrates
   exhibiting stronger OCT1 inhibition were mainly biaromatic
   beta-agonistic drugs, such as dobutamine, fenoterol, ractopamine and
   ritodrine. Biaromatic organic cations were both, strong inhibitors and
   good substrates, but many OCT1 substrates showed little pairwise
   inhibition. Surprisingly, sumatriptan did significantly enhance
   dobutamine uptake. This effect was concentration dependent and
   additional experiments indicated that efflux inhibition may be one of
   the underlying mechanisms. Our data suggests, that OCT1 substrates are
   mainly weak OCT1 inhibitors and among those inhibiting well,
   noncompetitive inhibition could be responsible. Weak competitive
   inhibition confirms that OCT1 inhibition screenings poorly predict OCT1
   substrates. Additionally, we showed that the OCT1 substrate sumatriptan
   can enhance uptake of some other OCT1 substrates. OCT1 transport
   stimulation was already observed earlier but is still poorly understood.
   Low OCT1 uptake inhibition and strong OCT1 efflux inhibition could be
   mechanisms exploitable for enhancing transport.},
